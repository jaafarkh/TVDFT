# TVDFT
this repository is dedicated to provide c++ implementation of Time Variant Discrete Fourier Transform with Non-Orthogonality Compensation.
Generate a simulated signal with close and cross orders and analyze it twice
with non-orthog. compensation enabled and with non-orthog. compensation disabled.
You can grab the data and plot it in Matlab or Excel
